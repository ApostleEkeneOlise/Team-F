PROJECT OVERVIEW (The Men and The Mandate)
Lost and Found Hub is a web app ably designed for a club to store and retrieve found items her patrons have lost within the club’s premises, and to seamlessly and securely process the recovery of such by the respective owners. This platform allows users to report lost items, and found items thereby enabling efficient tracking and retrieval. Relying on a navigable and user-centered webpage and a well-organized database, the platform ensures that specific misplaced belongings are returned to their rightful owners hassle free.
The Key Features:
•	Lost Item Reporting: Users can supply details of their lost item(s) such as: color, size, number, and images, as well as their contact information.
•	Found Items Log: Members can log found items, making them searchable for claimants.
•	Search and Match System: An intelligent matching feature helps link lost items with potential matches in the database.
•	Admin Dashboard: Club administrators oversee logs to verify and approve claims.

The aim of this project is to facilitate the club's “Lost And Found Items” management, thereby marrying efficiency with accountability while preserving members’ satisfaction. Lost and Found Hub was birthed by the thoughtful process of the great sextet called Team F.
